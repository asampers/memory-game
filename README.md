# Memory Game - Counting Cards

This is an implementation of the [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Memory Card assignment.

It is a simple game with the objective of clicking each card exactly once.

I utilized Chase Roberts' [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to generate a deck of cards and select 8 at a time.
